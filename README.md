# Machine Learning School Project

## Abstract
All the repository is based on the first approch that we get though the school curriculum. This approch form scratch some of the key concept of deep learning, such as supervised learning, unsupervied learning and so on.

The idea here is to re-build from scratch, even without any framework some of the main know algorythms. It's aim to build a full understanding of the key concepts.

Here you will find some works classifed on the different folder, that represent the different concepts of ML

## How to use it

Depend on the project, you may found or not the way to use it. If there is no instructions, it mean that it currently not avalable to be used (As the school as us to use TF on an older verison)

## Maths

Some of the main concept of the maths that take place under the hood of deep learning. All these maths are directly applyed in code

## Supervised Learning
From simple perceptron, to deep CNN, here is all the works related to this field.

### Main key concept
- Perceptron
- Shallow Neural Network
- Deep Neural Network
- CNN
  - VGG16 - VGG19
  - Inception
  - ResNet
  - DenseNet
- Object Detection
- Neural Style Transfer

## Licence
No Licence, free code
